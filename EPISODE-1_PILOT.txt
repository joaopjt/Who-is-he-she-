	RADIO STATION

JOHN
					“Radio WHCR 102.7, and the weather report,
					is going to be a rainy day after all, here
					in Chicago. You can check for details in our
					website, WHCR102.com or in our android/iOS
					application.”

	BACKGROUND SOUND - “The best radio station in Chicago, WHCR.”.

	The speaker takes his headphones out and get the papers on his left at the
	table. He takes a quick look at it, beats it against the table, turn his
	chair to the left and stands-up.

MARY
					I still can’t believe you are leaving us.

JOHN
					Bones of the Craft. Even in New York,
					I’ll be getting in touch with you later on.

MARY
					It’s a shame. We could still, at least,
					take the night out off in my apartment.

JOHN
					I can’t, got plans already. I taught you
					could’t see anyone out at Fridays.

MARY
					Markus dumped me off, again! So, that’s
					why I’m asking.

JOHN
					What happened to my last paycheck?
					The overall doesn’t work if I don’t get paid.

MARY
					A little less drama, John. I will speak
					to your boss before you leave, ok? Now,
					kiss me goodbye.

	John kisses her in the forehead and leaves.

	EXT. STREET

	BANK ENTRANCE - John walks in, sits in a waiting chair and picks his phone.
	Type something in it, and takes the phone back to his blazer. Stands-up,
	and talks to the line attendant.

JOHN
					Hi, I want to make a withdraw.

ATTENDANT
					How much do you want to withdraw?

JOHN
					$5000 bucks, please.

	WAIT’S FOR A WHILE…
ATTENDANT
					Here you go. Anything more I can do for you?

JOHN
					No, that will be all, thanks. Actually, can you
					do me a favor?!

ATTENDANT
					Yes, how can I help you?

JOHN
					I need contact with the investment team, would
					you give me your helpline desk number, please?

ATTENDANT
					Yes, I will give you our card, just a sec… Here
					you go. Anything more?

JOHN
					That will be all, thanks.

ATTENDANT
					You’re welcome.

	WALK AWAY.

	He goes into the sidewalk and calls for a taxi on the street.
	Enter in and say:

JOHN
					Hyde Park, please.

	The taxi takes him away. He stops in Nichols, John Fountain Park,
	and sits in a chair. Takes his phone out, and start using it.

JOHN
					Hi, sir, can you please tell me what time 
					it is?

PERSON #01
 					9pm.

	JOHN STARTS THINKING:
	“Is 8pm a clock on Hong Kong right now. I still can’t believe
	my withdraw didn’t fall trough it yet. I need to do some research.
	What about getting home earlier and write that code I need so much?”
